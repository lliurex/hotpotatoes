Release Notes for Java Hot Potatoes Beta 6.1.0.1
==========================

Thanks for your interest in our software.

FIRST:

You are using this software entirely at your own risk, and agree not to hold the authors or anyone else responsible for any loss or damage you incur in connection with use of this software.

JAVA PLATFORM:

This release is designed to run on the Java Virtual Machine version 1.4.2 and newer. 

The primary target for this release is Macintosh OS X. If you are updating your Mac properly with the Software Update... item in the Apple menu, the Java Virtual Machine running on your computer will support Hot Potatoes.
As a Java release, this program may also work in the Java Virtual Machines available for other Operating Systems (Windows, Linux etc.), but we make no claims about interoperability of the Java code. 

THIS RELEASE

All Potatoes: registration system changed to make the applications freeware. No registration key is needed, but you must enter your name into the program.  

JCloze: Bug fixed: in drop-down output, if the same answer appeared more than once and if it included a non-English character, then each instance appeared on the drop-down list instead of only one instance. Now, only one instance appears.

 1. What is HOT POTATOES?

HOT POTATOES is a suite of six programs for creating interactive educational exercises for the World Wide Web. These are the programs included, along with the types of exercise they create:
 JQuiz: multiple-choice, true-false,text-entry or short-answer 
 JCloze: gap-fill 
 JCross: crosswords
 JMix: jumbled-sentence 
 JMatch: matching and ordering 

All of the exercises use JavaScript and HTML for their functionality. 

The version 6 output will work only in Internet Explorer 6+, Mozilla 1.2+ and Netscape 7+. This output can also be automatically uploaded to the www.hotpotatoes.net hosting service. This output format will be the core format for the future. It is fully XHTML 1.1-compliant.

You do not need to know JavaScript or HTML in order to use these programs -- all you need to do is to enter your data (questions, answers etc.) and press a button, and the programs will create Web pages for you automatically. It couldn't be easier!
